# Repo Understanding

## Current Repo State

The repository currently contains:

- `README.md`: Aqualert AI problem, solution, software, and hardware summary.
- `context/evidence/Parentsquare Screenshot 1.png`: local evidence of school closure after a water main break.
- `context/evidence/Parentsquare Screenshot 2.png`: local evidence of low water pressure and operational disruption after a water main break.
- `LICENSE`.

## Role Of This Repo

This repo is now best treated as the SchoolPrint AI umbrella repo for the broader SchoolPulse system.

The current README summarizes the water, food, energy, and dashboard pieces. The Aqualert AI / LeakListener module remains the most developed concrete module. The next likely development work is to add:

- Sample or synthetic audio clips.
- Audio feature extraction.
- Binary classifier or anomaly detector.
- Edge inference plan for Raspberry Pi Zero.
- Alert payload schema for the SchoolPulse dashboard.
- Demo flow using the ParentSquare screenshots in `context/evidence/` as local problem proof.

## Useful MVP Shape

For the hackathon, a practical version could include:

- Recorded or synthetic normal-flow and leak-flow audio.
- A simple classifier or anomaly detector that outputs normal vs. leak.
- A severity estimate based on duration, confidence, and water-level/flow proxy data.
- A dashboard event such as `Water Ghost Detected`.
- A human verification step before any repair/work-order action.
